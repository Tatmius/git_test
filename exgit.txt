remote was set to git remote add origin https://github.com/Tatmius/git_test.git

I made a new branch named test_branch to test how "git push" works

I changed this text for "git push -u"

Even if I push the changes of the text with "-u" option, there's no pull request

I made fourth branch

I'm editing test_branch. I'll push this to origin with "-u" option
and then, I'll change fourth_branch and push it origin too.
After that, I'll checkout test_branch again and see how "git pull works"
